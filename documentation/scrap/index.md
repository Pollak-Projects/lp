## This is the initial documentation of the project. Just an idea!

- ### Learning pulse
  Learning Pulse is an innovative platform that blends the strength of Redmenta and Google Classroom to create a collaborative educational environment. Users can group students into virtual classes, assign teachers to each class, and provide various assessments such as exams, classwork, and quizzes.  
  The platform LearningPulse is designed for an audience involved in education, including schools, universities, and other  
  educational institutions. Its user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users.
- ## Stack
  - Java will be used for its backend as it is relatively easy to create platform using springboot. The server will be compiled into microservices that can run either on many nixos server or docker containers with the power of kubernetes.
  - The primary focus of the project will be a user-friendly frontend that will host the majority of its features. It will
    incorporate React, one of the most popular frontend frameworks, to provide a robust and seamless user experience.  
    Additionally, Tailwind will be utilized for theming purposes, while high-end storage solutions such as State Storage will  
    be applied for efficient data management.
- ## Testing
  - For testing idk..
- ## Key features
  - The application is divided into classes, each with a teacher who can post assignments,

    classwork, and quizzes/exams that the students can complete. This platform seamlessly  
    integrates multiple features and functions, creating a comprehensive learning environment.
  - Students have a personal drive where they can store and upload their work, which can then
    be attached to any assignments or quizzes in their classes. This drive is only accessible  
    to the student, unless they intentionally shares their work with a teacher. Additionally, this feature allows for real-time collaboration between students as they can share their work with each other.
  - AI chatbots are available on the platform to assist users in understanding its features and
    functions. These chatbots can provide help and answer questions to aid students in  
    completing their classwork. Administrators can choose to disable this feature entirely if  
    they do not have the necessary resources or find it disruptive to their teaching methods.  
    Additionally, during quizzes or exams, the AI chatbot can be disabled altogether to prevent  
    cheating. The AI chatbot also integrates seamlessly with other features, such as suggested exam  
    titles, and is included in the platform's office suite by default to aid with autofilling.
  - Next-level quizzes/exams. The quiz includes invasive measures that record every movement of
    the student, which can be viewed by the teacher. This allows them to detect any cheating. By default, this feature is disabled, but administrators may choose to enable it. If they do, the student is warned at the beginning of the quiz, ensuring them that their teachers are watching
